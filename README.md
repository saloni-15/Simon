# Simon Game
## About
The Simon game is an electronic game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order. It's fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can challenge you. Experience the fun as you repeat the patterns and advance to higher levels. 
This project provides you an online version of the Simon game, built using Javascript and Jquery.

## How to play
* Click [here](https://saloni-15.github.io/simon-game/) to open the game.
* At the beginning of the game, one of the 4 card flashes up randomly producing simultaneously a sound associated to the card.
* The player has to press the same card.
* Next, the Simon turns back the same flash on and a second one, again randomly.
* The player has to reproduce this chain of flash using his memory.
* And so on... In each round a new card is added to the series and the game becomes all the more difficult as the player's memory is put to the test.
* If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on and the level keeps on increasing, so it is an endless game!
